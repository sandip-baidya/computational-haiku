smoke-scented air 
sweep caskets
points a place sunset

spring break  
note budding
bills emerging whistle

a deceased friend
bright evening funeral
finger dick-ass no

chilly morning
totem someone's
water find dock pills

frozen morning
weaves muddy
fell dew fishing keys

equinox sunrise
runs lineups
back our which the touch

wind swirls
inspecting
extra sharp skunk inside

a single bubble
pile wing bike
kitchen lottery numbers

night rain 
ray of outside
song moving rabbit's

a mandala
decade hidden
hoarder's kite's seat clapped
